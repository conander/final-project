# Final Project

>Critique by Connor Anderson

## Introduction:

This is a review of the [Oregon HazVu: Statewide Geohazard Viewer][1] created by the Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI) on October 1, 2012, using the ESRI ArcGIS server. HazVu is meant to provide the public with an interactive map that shows the locations of many different geologic hazards within the state of Oregon. Anyone can search for a place or address to view the geohazards that are likely to affect the area. For instance, the user can search their address and overlay the Earthquake Hazard layer to see the severity of the expected earthquake shake surrounding their home.

## Body:

**Basemaps:**
HazVu opens with a standard gray canvas basemap from ESRI but has several basemaps compiled within a gallery for the customization of the userâ€™s experience. The basemap inventory contains canvas maps, satellite imagery, topographic/terrain, and open street maps.

**Thematic Layers:**
Each thematic layer or operational layer of the map shows the locations of different geohazards. These layers include buildings, radon potential, flood hazard, Cascadia earthquake hazard, coastal erosion hazard, volcano hazard, earthquake hazard, landslide hazard, landslide inventory, highest hit lidar hillshade, and bare earth lidar hillshade. The user has the option of looking at one or multiple layers at a time.

**Interactive Features:**
The map provides various interactive tools to aid in understanding the subject matter. For instance, the audience can use the search bar to zoom the frame to a specified location or use the My Location button to zoom to their current location. If the user would like to zoom out to the default overview of Oregon, they can click the default extent button. You also have the option to measure the area of a specified polygon, the distance between two or more placed points (hazard distance) or find the coordinates of a single point with the provided measurement tool. You can select the print button if you would like to save a screenshot of the map content as a pdf, jpg, etc.

**Map Elements:**
The web map has several elements including a zoom tool and search bar on the upper left, a scale bar and coordinate display on the lower left, an inset overview map on the lower right, and a legend menu that loads beneath the search bar once a thematic layer is selected.


## Discussion & Conclusion:

The Oregon HazVu map provides the audience with user-friendly tools to create and explore a hazard map unique to their situation. In summary, DOGAMI has made it easier for the public to explore and educate themselves on the extent of local geologic hazards.

**Any room for future development?**
The map could include more numerical data or make data retrieval easier. I would like to see them add a fixed legend to the upper right corner of the screen that updates to whatever layers are active. Otherwise, it seems well developed and even includes a link for a help/information page.

**Take-home message:**
The data provided should not be used for professional purposes but rather be used by the public to learn more about how different geologic hazards might affect you and your surroundings.
